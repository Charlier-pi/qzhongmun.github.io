### STABLE	MATCHING

Unstable pair.	Hospital h and student s form an unstable pair if both:
	* h prefers s to one of its admitted students.
	* s prefers h to assigned hospital.

perfect matching only if the number of h = the number of s

perfect matching may not be stable matching

Stable matching: perfect matching with stable pairs
