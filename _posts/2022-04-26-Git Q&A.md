Q:
> git push -u origin master
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

A:
I know about this problem. After add ssh key, add you ssh key to ssh agent too (from official docs)
ssh-agent -s
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

solved!
