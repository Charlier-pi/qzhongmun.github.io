## unstable matching
```
/*
Def. Given a perfect matching M , hospital h and student s form an unstable pair if both: 
* h prefers s to matched student. 
* s prefers h to matched hospital.
*/

A-Y  //* h(A) prefers s(Y) to(rather than) matched student(red part).
     //* s prefers h to matched hospital.
