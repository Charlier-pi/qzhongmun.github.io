### what is Serverless

advantages
```
1. serverless architectures offer greater scalability, more flexibility, and quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost.

2. Developers are only charged for the server space they use, reducing cost

3. increasing the size of its fleet as the amount of mail spikes (say, just before Mother's Day) and decreasing its fleet for times when fewer deliveries are necessary.
 Applications built with a serverless infrastructure will scale automatically as the user base grows or usage increases.
 
4. Code can run closer to the end user, decreasing latency
 ```
 
disadvantages
```
1. Debugging is more complicated because developers do not have visibility into backend processes, and because the application is broken up into separate, smaller functions

2. Because companies are not assigned their own discrete physical servers, serverless providers will often be running code from several of their customers on a single server at any given time.

3. cost more time for long-running processes in a serverless infrastructure compared to a traditional one.

4. Performance may be affected

5. Setting up a serverless architecture with one vendor can make it difficult to switch vendors if necessary, especially since each vendor offers slightly different features and workflows.

When should developers avoid using a serverless architecture?
```
 large applications with a fairly constant, predictable workload may require a traditional setup, and in such cases the traditional setup is probably less expensive.
